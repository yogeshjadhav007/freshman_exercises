# Note: Write you code below the comments

# Write a function that will take an argument and key word argument and print them


# Write a function that will take in a number n as argument and and run a loop printing that the iteration number

# Write a function that will take in an argument, if the argument is None, raise an exception

# Write a function that will take in a kwargs as dictionary and print it.

# Write a funcction that will compare length of two strings passed to it.

# Write a function that will take in 2 arguments of type int ex. a and b, write nested loops where the loops should run
# for a and b time resp.

# define a function called main_function define another function named nested_function within the main_function
# call nested function from within the main_function
# Note: the nested and main functions defined above should have appropriate print statements.


# define a function called main_function with argument "name" define another function named nested_function within the main_function which takes argument name also
# nested_function should calculate the len of the name passed to it
# print the length  of the string returned from the lenght function

# The function defined above should handle exceptions
# Example: None is passed instead of name in nested function
# the nested function should raise an exception
# the main function should catch that exception and handle it by printing the "Error"
